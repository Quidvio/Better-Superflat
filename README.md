# Better-Superflat
Tired of the boring single-biome vanilla superflat options? Tired of not having all the structures you'd normally get? Wish the nether was also superflat? Maybe even the end. 

This datapack is the solution. 

This datapack makes the overworld, nether, and end superflat, while maintaining biomes, structures, caves, rivers, and oceans, ores, etc.
Oceans and rivers are normal, but all of the terrain above is flat.

This Datapack was made possible thanks to Jochen Jacobs' worldgen noise editor, Snowcapped!

Strongly recommend trying it out if you want to mess around with worldgen, and show your support to him if you use this datapack!

If you have any suggested changes to this, I can upload them for you (like adding a nether roof, redesigning the end, making the nether/end normal and leave the overworld flat, do something different with oceans, etc.)

Also, likely due to a bug, Nether Fossils do not generate. I swear it literally makes no sense why, you cannot even use the place structure command to place any. 

Desert Temples were the same way, but I pulled some witch-craft to make them work (it took 5 hours ðŸ™ƒ)
