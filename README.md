# Better Superflat Datapack Collection for Minecraft 1.20

Tired of the boring single-biome vanilla superflat options?

Try out my Datapacks!

All of the datapacks in this collection create superflat-style world generation, but have all the biomes and structures of a regular world.

There are a few different varieties of packs included for extra customization. 



This datapack makes the overworld, nether, and end all superflat while keeping their biomes, structures, caves, rivers, oceans, ores, foliage, etc.

Oceans and rivers are normal, but all of the terrain above is flat.

This Datapack was made possible thanks to Jochen Jacobs' worldgen noise editor, Snowcapped!

If you have any suggested changes to this, I can upload them for you (like adding a nether roof, redesigning the end, making the nether/end normal and leave the overworld flat, do something different with oceans, etc.)

Also, likely due to a bug, Nether Fossils do not generate. I swear it literally makes no sense why, you cannot even use the place structure command to place any. 

Desert Temples were the same way, but I pulled some witch-craft to make them work (it took 5 hours ðŸ™ƒ)
